    <h1>🌸 Our Beautiful Journey 🌸</h1>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Oct 2019 – When We First Met</h3>
      <p>The moment I saw you, I didn’t know you’d mean this much to me. But that was the day my life quietly changed forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Mar 2020 – Our Story Shattered</h3>
      <p>Life threw misunderstandings, gossips, and pain our way. We lost what we had... and I lost a part of myself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Jun 2020 – Your First Birthday After We Met</h3>
      <p>We weren’t talking, but my heart couldn’t forget you. The gift still found its way to you... even if we were apart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Jul 2020 – My Love Truly Began</h3>
      <p>Even without your words, I started to realize how deeply I loved you. The silence taught me your place in my heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Dec 2021 – You Accepted My Love</h3>
      <p>After countless struggles, tears, and time... you finally believed in my love. That was the day my world became whole.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Feb 2022 – Our First Valentine's Day</h3>
      <p>The first special day you gifted me with your love — a memory I’ll hold forever in my soul.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Jun 2022 – Your First Birthday as My Love</h3>
      <p>That scooty ride to the temple — our simple yet divine temple date. It felt like a blessing written just for us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Oct 2022 – The Greatest Loss of My Life</h3>
      <p>My mom left this world, leaving a void. But before she left, she unknowingly gave me you — my second mother, my strongest love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Dec 2022 – Our First Anniversary</h3>
      <p>A milestone that meant everything to me — we completed one beautiful year, filled with love, growth, and countless memories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Feb 2023 – Our Second Valentine's Day</h3>
      <p>Though it wasn’t perfect, our love was still there, quietly waiting behind the misunderstandings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Jun 2023 – Your Second Birthday With Me</h3>
      <p>I tried to make you feel just how special you are to me... not with grand things, but with all my heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Nov 2023 – We Fell Apart</h3>
      <p>Because of my own mistakes, I lost the most precious person in my life. Those six months felt like a lifetime without you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>May 2024 – Our Second Beginning</h3>
      <p>I changed. I begged. I proved. And by God’s grace, you gave me one more chance — the most meaningful gift I’ve ever received.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Jun 2024 – Your Third Birthday as My Love</h3>
      <p>We spent just two hours together, but every second felt like magic. I gave you a memory — from your family, for your heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Dec 2024 – Our Third Anniversary</h3>
      <p>We walked along the beach, laughed like kids, and held hands like soulmates. Three years of us... and it still feels like day one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
      <h3>Feb 2025 – Our Fourth Valentine's Day</h3>
      <p>With my first month salary, I bought a ring — not just a gift, but a promise. That day in the temple, I felt half-married to you already.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="milestone">
  <h3>Jun 2025 – Your Birthday, My Forever Girl 🎂</h3>
  <p>This birthday isn’t just another year… it’s another year of *us*. I don’t need a reason to celebrate you, but this day — your day — is a reminder of how blessed I am to have you in my life. This time, I want to give you more than a gift… I want to give you a piece of my heart, forever wrapped in memories, love, and promises.</p>
